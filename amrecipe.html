				<h2>Chicken Tikka Masala</h2>
				by Abdullah Mamun
				<h3>Ingredients</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>6 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
					<li>4 tsp. finely grated peeled ginger</li>
					<li>4 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
					<li>2 tsp. garam masala</li>
					<li>2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
					<li>2 tsp. ground cumin</li>
					<li>1.5 cups whole-milk yogurt (not Greek)</li>
					<li>1 Tbsp. kosher salt</li>
					<li>2 lb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise</li>
					<li>3 Tbsp. ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil</li>
					<li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
					<li>.1 cup tomato paste</li>
					<li>6 cardamom pods, crushed</li>
					<li>2 dried chiles de árbol or ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
					<li>1 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes, like San Marzano</li>
					<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
					<li>.3 cup chopped cilantro, plus sprigs for garnish</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Directions</h3>
				<p>Step 1: Combine garlic, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, and cumin in a small bowl. Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture.</p>
				<p>Step 2: Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes.</p>
				<p>Step 3: Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.</p>
				<p>Step 4: Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes.</p>
				<p>Step 5: Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.</p>
				<p>Step 6: Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs.</p>
